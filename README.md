# Q2
The Question 2 folder contains code for Q2 which fills out the Kalman filter code provided by the instructors. The two files can simply be ran as-is and the corresponding Kalman filter output plots will appear.

# Q3
The Roll A Ball game is the rest of the repository as I wasn't able to put the Unity files in a separate Q3 folder. The game was created in Unity and there is also a video of the game being played uploaded with the repository.
